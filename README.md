 Developers: We share the website's problem, idea and some primary functions together. To be more specific, Long was in charge mainly of Javascript and function, and Manh worked on the design and interface with CSS. About the responsive function, Long spent several first days working on, before Manh could debug and test our website. After that, we also had several meetings to utilise our product.
Responsive, debugging, testing

 Web design:
- How did you design the website?
1. Find inspiration 
2. Look for examples in the field 
3) Design Prototype 
4. Build the first draft 
5) Test among ourselves 
6) Add responsive and related requirements 
7) Test among ourselves and debug

 What principles (working methodology) did you work according to?
1. Safety: must not pose any threat to the user's health
2. Protection of personal information
3. Functionality: Based on human needs
4. Accessibility: Users must have access via the user interface: locates, uses
5. Efficiency: user doesn’t need to use too many steps to access the website and use the product
6. Ease of use: How easy it is to learn a system, and how easy it is to remember how to use it
7. Appeal: A good system has lasting appeal over time

- How did you implement the solutions?
 We follow the “good user interface” steps mentioned in the lecture 3 slides.
- The technology used for implementation: just Javascript without the Javascript template, HTML5, CSS3

Why the website is user-friendly: 
1) Simple design. Use mostly 3 clearly contrast colour: black, white, and blue
2) All heading and text area are clearly marked
3) All information related is layout in 1 page and easy to navigate to
